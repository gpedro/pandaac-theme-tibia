                        you are aware of the following points:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>In case you get a red or black skull or a final warning after having paid for a pending 
                            character world transfer, you will have to wait until the final warning or the skull mark have 
                            been gone before you can move to the new game world.</li>
                            <li>Note that you can only move to game worlds with stricter or the same PvP rules. Therefore, 
                            if you move your character to an optional PvP game world, it will be impossible to move it 
                                back to an open or hardcore PvP game world at a later point.</li>
                            <li>If you move to a new game world make sure that you select one that is close to your home. 
                            If a Brazilian player moves from a game world located in the USA to one located in Europe, 
                            he will very likely experience a worse connection than before.</li>
                        </ul>
